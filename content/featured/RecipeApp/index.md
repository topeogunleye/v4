Ever struggled to figure out how the MealDB API works? Well, I've been there, so I created a course that explains everything in simple terms.

Unlike other tutorials that only cover bits and pieces, my course walks you through everything, from the basics of REST APIs to fetching data in a React app. And by the end, you'll have a cool app ready to show off in your portfolio. No confusing GitHub repositories, just straightforward learning and a practical project to brag about! ðŸš€
